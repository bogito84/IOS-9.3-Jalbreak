## How to Jalbreak

Step 1. Confirm that you’ve downloaded all of the necessary components (Cydia Impactor and the latest Pangu jailbreak IPA) from the below download section and that you’re running the latest version of iTunes.

Step 2. Either unzip Cydia Impactor on Windows or copy the app to your Applications folder on Mac OS X and run the tool.

Note: Mac users may have to allow running applications from sources outside of the App Store in System Preferences > Security & Privacy before opening.

Step 3. Drag the Pangu NvwaStone_1.0.ipad into the Cydia impactor interface and click the “Start” button.

Step 4. Input your Apple ID and passcode when prompted (this is just to sign the app and get it onto your device – don’t worry, Saurik has confirmed that the info is passed straight to Apple and not through a third-party server).

Step 5. If you receive an “Apple Developer Warning”, simply click “OK”. This alert pops up if you have previous developer certificates associated with your Apple ID; Impactor needs to revoke them to sign the app properly.

Step 6. Trust the development profile inside of Settings > General > Device Management.

Step 7. Launch the PP app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, enable push notifications, and tap the start button in the middle of the app to proceed with the jailbreak. After roughly 5 seconds, lock your device and wait for it to respring.

  Important Note: While you can press the home button to view the push notification status of the jailbreak (if it mentions Cydia, you’re golden), do not unlock and/or close the app.

Next you’ll need to learn how to reboot following the success of your semi untethered jailbreak on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch!

## How To Reboot After Jailbreak
Once jailbroken, you may notice that upon a reboot, Cydia (and anything obtained through Cydia) crashes. That’s because this is a “semi untethered” jailbreak so to speak – i.e. while you don’t need a computer to reboot it, you’ll have to re-apply the kernel patch to use any jailbreak-related items. It’s very simple to accomplish this, just follow the below steps.

Step 1. After a reboot, open the PP app.

Step 2. Wait 20 seconds in the app before doing anything (this is very important), and then tap the circle in the middle to begin the kernel patch process.

Step 3. Roughly 5 seconds after tapping the circle, lock your device. If the screen remains black and unresponsive and/or you get a notification from PP, you did it right (don’t worry, if it’s not both, either should work)!
  Note:  If your device just reboots, it didn’t initialize the jailbreak properly. In that case, please repeat the three steps listed above.
